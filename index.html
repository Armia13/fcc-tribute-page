            <h2>Early life</h2>
            <p>Umar was born in Mecca to the Banu Adi clan.His father was Khattab ibn Nufayl and his mother was Hantama
                bint Hisham. In his youth he used to tend to his father's camels in the plains near Mecca. His merchant
                father was famed for his intelligence among his tribe. Umar himself said: <span class="bold">"My father, Al-Khattab
                    was a ruthless man. He used to make me work hard; if I didn't work he used to beat me and he used to
                    work me to exhaustion."</span>

                Umar learned to read and write in his youth. He developed a love for poetry and literature. According to
                the tradition of Quraish, while still in his teenage years, Umar learned martial arts, horse riding and
                wrestling. He was tall, physically powerful and a renowned wrestler. He was also a gifted orator who
                succeeded his father as an arbitrator among the tribes.</p>
        </div>
        <div id="phy-appearance">
            <h2>Physical appearance</h2>
            <p>Umar was strong, fit, athletic and good at wrestling. From first hand accounts of his physical appearance
                Umar is said to be vigorous, robust and a very tall man; in markets he would tower above the people. The
                front part of his head was bald, always A'sara Yusran (working with two hands),both his eyes were black,
                with yellow skin; however, ibn Sa'ad in his book stated that he never knew that 'Umar had yellow skin,
                except for a certain part of Umar's life where his color changed due to his frequent consumption of oil.
                Others say he had reddish-white skin. His teeth were ashnabul asnan (very white shining). He would
                always color his beard and take care of his hair using a type of plant.</p>
        </div>
        <div id="enemy-islam">
            <h2>Initial hostility to Islam</h2>
            <p>In 610 Muhammad started preaching the message of Islam. Like many others in Mecca, Umar opposed Islam and
                he even threatened to kill Muhammad. He was adamant and cruel in opposing Muhammad and very prominent in
                persecuting Muslims.Due to persecution, Muhammad ordered some of his followers to migrate to Abyssinia.
                When a small group of Muslims migrated, Umar became worried about the future unity of the Quraish and
                decided to have Muhammad assassinated.</p>
        </div>
        <div id="conversion">
            <h2>Conversion to Islam</h2>
            <p>Umar converted to Islam in 616. On his way to murder Muhammad, Umar met his best friend Nua'im bin
                Abdullah who had secretly converted to Islam but had not told Umar. Nuaimal Hakim told him to inquire
                about his own house where his sister and her husband had converted to Islam.<br> Upon arriving at her
                house, Umar found his sister and brother-in-law Saeed bin Zaid reciting the
                verses of the Quran from sura Ta-Ha. He started quarreling with his brother-in-law. When his sister came
                to rescue her husband, he also started quarreling with her. Yet still they kept on saying "you may kill
                us but we will not give up Islam". Upon hearing these words, Umar slapped his sister so hard that she
                fell to the ground bleeding from her mouth. When he saw what he did to his sister, he calmed down out of
                guilt and asked his sister to give him what she was reciting. His sister replied in the negative and
                said "You are unclean, and no unclean person can touch the Scripture." He insisted, but his sister was
                not prepared to allow him to touch the pages unless he washed his body. Umar at last gave in. He washed
                his body and then began to read the verses that were: <span class="bold">Verily, I am Allah: there is no
                    God but Me; so serve Me (only), and establish regular prayer for My remembrance (Quran
                    20:14).</span> He wept and declared,<span class="bold">"Surely this is the word of Allah. I bear
                    witness that Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah."</span><br>Umar then went to Muhammad with the same
                sword he intended to kill him with and accepted Islam in front
                of him and his companions. Umar was 39 years old when he accepted Islam.<br>Umar's conversion to Islam
                granted power to the Muslims and to the Islamic faith in Mecca. It was after
                this event that Muslims offered prayers openly in Masjid al-Haram for the first time.</p>

        <div id="appointment">
            <h2>Appointment as a caliph</h2>
            <p>Abu Bakr appointed Umar as his successor before dying. Due to his strict and autocratic nature, Umar was
                not a very popular figure among the notables of Medina. Nevertheless, Abu Bakr decided to make Umar his
                successor. Abu Bakr was aware of Umar's power and ability to succeed him. His was perhaps one of the
                smoothest transitions of power from one authority to another in the Muslim lands. Before his death, Abu
                Bakr called Uthman to write his will in which he declared Umar his successor. In his will he instructed
                Umar to continue the conquests on Iraqi and Syrian fronts.</p>

        <div id="caliphate">
            <h2>Umar's Caliphate</h2>
            <div id="image">
                <p>The government of Umar was a unitary government, where the sovereign political authority was the
                    caliph.The empire of Umar was divided into provinces and some autonomous territories<br>
                    The Islamic Caliphate under Islam's second Caliph, Umar ibn Al-Khattab reached (modern-day)
                    Palestine,
                    Syria, Iraq, Egypt, Iran and beyond within his 10-year rule. Umar's caliphate is notable for its
                    many
                    conquests. His generals conquered Iraq, Iran, Azerbaijan, Kirman, Seistan, Khurasan, Syria, Jordan,
                    Palestine and Egypt, and incorporated them into the empire of the Muslims.
                    Umar ruled with fairness and justice.<br>
                    Umar was a pioneer in some affairs:<br>
                    Umar was the first to introduce the public ministry system, where the records of officials and
                    soldiers
                    were kept. He also kept a record system for messages he sent to Governors and heads of state.
                    He was the first to appoint police forces to keep civil order.
                    He was the first to discipline the people when they became disordered.<br>
                    Under Umar's rule, in order to promote strict discipline, Arab soldiers were settled outside of
                    cities, between the desert and cultivated lands in special garrison towns known as "amsar". Known
                    examples of such settlements are Basra and Kufa, in Iraq, and Fustat south of what would later
                    become Cairo. His soldiers were forbidden to own land outside of Arabia. There were restrictions on
                    their right to seize buildings and other immovable things usually thought of as prizes of war.
                    Movable spoils were shared with the people of the umma, regardless of their social stratum</p>

            <h2>Assassination</h2>
            <p>In 644, Umar was assassinated by a Persian slave named Abu Lulu by later accounts. His motivation for the
                assassination is not clear. One possible explanation was that it was done in response to the Muslim
                conquest of Persia.The assassination was planned several months earlier. In October 644, Umar undertook
                a Hajj to Mecca, during which the assassins pronounced Umar's imminent death that year, and the massive
                crowd of the congregation was used by the conspirators as a veil to hide themselves.<br>
                On 31 October 644, Piruz attacked Umar while he was leading the morning prayers, stabbing him six times
                in the belly and finally in the navel, that proved fatal. Umar was left profusely bleeding while Piruz
                tried to flee, but people from all sides rushed to capture him; in his efforts to escape he is reported
                to have wounded twelve other people, six or nine of whom later died, before slashing himself with his
                own blade to commit suicide.<br>
                Umar died of the wounds three days later on Wednesday 3 November 644 (26th Dhū al-Ḥijja 23).<br>
                As per Umar's will, he was buried next to Al-Masjid al-Nabawi alongside Muhammad and caliph Abu Bakr by
                the permission of Aisha.</p>
